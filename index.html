                <h3>Methods of Weather Prediction:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP):</strong> Uses mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans to predict the weather based on current conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Statistical Methods:</strong> Involves analyzing historical weather data to identify patterns and trends that can predict future weather.</li>
                    <li><strong>Satellite Observations:</strong> Satellites provide real-time data on weather patterns, helping meteorologists to track storms and other weather events.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Tools for Weather Prediction:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Supercomputers:</strong> Used to run complex weather models and simulations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Doppler Radar:</strong> Measures the velocity of particles in the atmosphere, helping to predict severe weather conditions like tornadoes and hurricanes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weather Balloons:</strong> Collect data on temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure at different altitudes.</li>

                <h3>Significant Historical Weather Events:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Dust Bowl (1930s):</strong> A severe drought that affected the Great Plains of the United States, causing massive dust storms and agricultural damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hurricane Katrina (2005):</strong> One of the deadliest hurricanes in U.S. history, causing widespread flooding and destruction in New Orleans and surrounding areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>The European Heatwave (2003):</strong> A record-breaking heatwave that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths across Europe.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Impact of Historical Weather Events:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> Many historical weather events have caused significant economic damage, including destruction of infrastructure, agricultural losses, and increased insurance costs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Severe weather events can lead to long-term environmental changes, such as desertification, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Societal Impact:</strong> Weather events can have profound effects on society, including displacement of populations, changes in settlement patterns, and shifts in public policy.</li>
